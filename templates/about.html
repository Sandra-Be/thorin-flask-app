        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
        recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
        Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
        Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
        Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
        action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
        leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the city of The Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, he
                and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he
                quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in
                TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his
                shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield,"
                which would remain with him even in death.

            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews of
                Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
                the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            <h3>Óin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the
                father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of
                Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the
                Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.

            <h3>Gloin</h3>
            <p>
                Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the Dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and younger
                brother of Óin.
                In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves
                and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.
                In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March of TA
                2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so
                that Smaug wouldn't start an alliance with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them as
                "simpletons" and also said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet
                new from the shell".

            <h3>Balin</h3>
            <p>
                Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named
                Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards, he may
                have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the
                Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin,
                when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

            <h3>Dwalin</h3>
            <p>
                Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and younger
                brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thráin II and
                Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.
                Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered
                Luin on a Quest to reclaim Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845, Thráin was
                captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. After a
                fruitless search for their king, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the news.
